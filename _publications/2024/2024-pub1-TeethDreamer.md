  Orthodontic treatment usually requires regular face-to-face examinations to monitor dental conditions of the patients. When in person diagnosis is not feasible, an alternative is to utilize five intra-oral photographs for remote dental monitoring.

  However, it lacks of 3D in formation, and how to reconstruct 3D dental models from such sparse view photographs is a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a 3D teeth reconstruction framework, named TeethDreamer, aiming to restore the shape and position of the upper and lower teeth. Given f ive intra-oral photographs, our approach first leverages a large diffu sion modelâ€™s prior knowledge to generate novel multi-view images with known poses to address sparse inputs and then reconstructs high-quality 3D teeth models by neural surface reconstruction. To ensure the 3D con sistency across generated views, we integrate a 3D-aware feature atten tion mechanism in the reverse diffusion process. Moreover, a geometry aware normal loss is incorporated into the teeth reconstruction process to enhance geometry accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over current state-of-the-arts, giving the po tential to monitor orthodontic treatment remotely.
