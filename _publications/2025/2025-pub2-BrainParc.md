  Accurate brain parcellation from structural MRI (sMRI) across the human lifespan is essential for advancing neuroimaging and neuroscience studies. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize due to intensity and contrast variations across brain maturation, aging, and differences in MRI acquisition protocols, limiting their clinical and research utility.

  To address this, we present BrainParc, a unified parcellation framework that leverages anatomical information invariant to intensity and contrast, enabling accurate, robust, and longitudinally consistent parcellation across heterogeneous dataset without the need for fine-tuning. We curated the largest known sMRI dataset to date, comprising over 93300 T1w MRI data from 19 globally distributed cohorts spanning ages 0-100 years, to train and rigorously evaluate BrainParc. Extensive experiments on both internal and external datasets demonstrate that BrainParc significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in delineating 106 brain regions, achieving average Dice scores of 95.48% internally and 94.10% externally. BrainParc consistently shows superior performance across diverse populations and imaging conditions, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Beyond anatomical segmentation, we show that BrainParc enables reliable tracking of brain development and facilitates early diagnosis of neurological disorders, underscoring its potential as a robust and generalizable tool for large-scale neuroimaging studies and clinical translation.
